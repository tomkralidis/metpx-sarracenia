NOTE BENE:  THIS IS NOT DONE YET!

current status:
	ncsReceiver & ncsSender uses old style configs.
        pxReceiver & pxSender uses the new.

     header2client.conf
     collection_stations.conf
     collections.conf
     rx/
        <source>.conf
     tx/
	<client>.conf

header2client.conf -- the direct route mapping table. 
Each header is on it's own line, three fields per line, colon separated.
AHL on the left, list of destinations in the middle, priority is third field.
sample line:
SICA01 MSLP:A E C H S F O Q:5:

collectons_stations.conf -- the list of stations included in each collective bulletin.
space separated lines, first field is the AHL with the space removed, rest
are the four letter station id's for collections.

(OLD CONFIG: stnlist in etc.sample)

collections.conf -- configuration file for collection process.
  -- same as existing one.

-------------------------------------
For each receptions circuit (a "source" in px parlance), there
is a configuration file in the rx directory.  by creating

samples of rx/<source>.conf

For each outgoing circuit, there 
-----------------------------
    sample etc/tx/ppp1_wmo.conf

active yes

For each circuit, there is a spooling/queueing directory.
/apps/px/rx/<source>  for sources, and /apps/px/tx/<client> for outgoing ones.
